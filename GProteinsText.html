				<B><font color=#0000FF><b>SIGNALING MECHANISMS &amp; DRUG ACTION</b></font></B><BR><BR><A NAME="o90"></A><B><b>Introduction</b></B><BR><BR>Until now we have considered <A NAME="1"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> interactions and drug effects in terms of equations and concentration-effect curves. This abstract analysis explains some quantitative aspects of drug action. For a more complete explanation, we must also understand the molecular mechanisms by which a drug acts. This understanding is particularly important for drugs that mimic or block intercellular signaling by hormones and neurotransmitters.<BR><BR>The research of the past 10 years has revealed in considerable detail the molecular processes that transduce extracellular signals into intracellular messages that control cell function. Understanding these remarkable signaling mechanisms allows us to ask basic questions with important clinical implications: Why do some drugs produce effects that persist for minutes, hours, or even days after the drug is no longer present? How do cellular mechanisms for amplifying external chemical signals explain the phenomenon of spare receptors? Why do chemically similar drugs often exhibit extraordinary selectivity in their actions? Can the signaling mechanisms explain actions of drugs that do not interact with receptors? Do these mechanisms provide targets for developing new drugs? Our new understanding allows us not only to ask these questions but also&#151;in many cases&#151;to answer them.<BR><BR>Most transmembrane signaling is accomplished by only a few different molecular mechanisms. Each type of mechanism has been adapted, through the evolution of distinctive protein families, to transduce many different signals. These protein families include receptors on the cell surface and within the cell, as well as enzymes and other components that generate, amplify, coordinate, and terminate postreceptor signaling by chemical second messengers in the cytoplasm. This section first discusses the mechanisms for carrying chemical information across the plasma membrane and then outlines key features of cytoplasmic second messengers.<BR><BR>Five basic mechanisms of transmembrane signaling are well understood (Figure 2-8). Each uses a different strategy to circumvent the barrier posed by the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. These strategies use (1) a lipid-soluble ligand that crosses the membrane and acts on an intracellular <A NAME="2"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>; (2) a transmembrane <A NAME="3"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> protein whose intracellular enzymatic activity is allosterically regulated by a ligand that binds to a site on the protein's extracellular domain; (3) a transmembrane <A NAME="4"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> that binds and stimulates a protein tyrosine kinase; (4) a ligand-gated transmembrane ion channel that can be induced to open or close by the binding of a ligand; or (5) a transmembrane <A NAME="5"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> protein that stimulates a GTP-binding signal transducer protein (G protein), which in turn generates an intracellular second messenger.<BR><BR>While the five established mechanisms do not account for all the chemical signals conveyed across cell membranes, they do transduce many of the most important signals exploited in pharmacotherapy.<BR><BR><A NAME="o3130"></A><B><b>Intracellular Receptors for Lipid-Soluble Agents</b></B><BR><BR>Several biologic signals are sufficiently lipid-soluble to cross the plasma membrane and act on intracellular receptors. One of these is a gas, nitric oxide (NO), that acts by stimulating an intracellular enzyme, guanylyl cyclase, which produces cGMP. Signaling via cGMP is described in more detail later in this chapter. Receptors for another class of ligands&#151;including <b>corticosteroids, mineralocorticoids, sex steroids, vitamin D,</b> and <b>thyroid hormone</b>&#151;stimulate the transcription of genes in the nucleus by binding to specific DNA sequences near the gene whose expression is to be regulated. Many of the target DNA sequences (called <b>response elements</b>) have been identified.<BR><BR>The detailed molecular mechanisms used by these "gene-active" receptors are well understood. Structural features common to these receptors suggest that they belong to a protein family that evolved from a common precursor. Dissection of the receptors by recombinant DNA techniques has provided insights into their molecular mechanisms. For example, removal of a carboxyl terminal segment of the glucocorticoid <A NAME="6"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> results in a protein that binds to the DNA response element and stimulates transcription of the target gene, even in the absence of glucocorticoids. Like this experimental truncation, binding of glucocorticoid hormone to the normal <A NAME="7"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> relieves an inhibitory constraint on the transcription-stimulating activity of the protein. Figure 2-9 schematically depicts the molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid action: In the absence of hormone, the <A NAME="8"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> is bound to hsp90, a protein that appears to prevent normal folding of several structural domains of the <A NAME="9"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>. Binding of hormone to the ligand-binding domain triggers release of hsp90. This allows the DNA-binding and transcription-activating domains of the <A NAME="10"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> to fold into their functionally active conformations, so that the activated <A NAME="11"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> can initiate transcription of target genes.<BR><BR>The mechanism used by hormones that act by regulating gene expression has two therapeutically important consequences: (1) All of these hormones produce their effects after a characteristic lag period of 30 minutes to several hours&#151;the time required for the synthesis of new proteins. This means that the gene-active hormones cannot be expected to alter a pathologic state within minutes&#151;eg, glucocorticoids will not immediately relieve the symptoms of acute bronchial asthma. (2) The effects of these agents can persist for hours or days after the agonist concentration has been reduced to zero. The persistence of effect is primarily due to the relatively slow turnover of most enzymes and proteins, which can remain active in cells for hours or days after they have been synthesized. (The persistence may also be partially due to the high affinity of receptors for the hormone, which results in slow dissociation of the hormone.) Therapeutically, it means that the beneficial (or toxic) effects of a gene-active hormone will usually decrease slowly when administration of the hormone is stopped and that there will be no simple temporal correlation between plasma concentration of the hormone and its effects.<BR><BR><A NAME="o6405"></A><B><b>Ligand-Regulated Transmembrane Enzymes Including <A NAME="12"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Receptor</FONT></B></A> Tyrosine Kinases</b></B><BR><BR>This class of <A NAME="13"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> molecules mediates the first steps in signaling by <b>insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>),</b> and several other trophic hormones. These receptors are polypeptides consisting of an extracellular hormone-binding domain and a cytoplasmic enzyme domain, which may be a protein tyrosine kinase, a serine kinase, or a guanylyl cyclase (Figure 2-10). In all these receptors, the two domains are connected by a hydrophobic segment of the polypeptide that crosses the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane.<BR><BR>The <A NAME="14"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> tyrosine kinase signaling pathway begins with hormone binding to the <A NAME="15"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>'s extracellular domain. The resulting change in <A NAME="16"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> conformation causes <A NAME="17"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> molecules to bind to one another, which in turn brings together the protein tyrosine kinase domains, which become enzymatically active. Tyrosine residues in both cytoplasmic domains become phosphorylated (each is probably phosphorylated by the other). This cross-phosphorylation can intensify or prolong the duration of allosteric regulation by the hormonal ligand. For example, the tyrosine kinase activity of the autophosphorylated insulin <A NAME="18"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> persists after insulin is removed from the binding site. Different receptors catalyze phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on different downstream signaling proteins, but only a few of these substrate proteins have been identified. Insulin, for example, uses a single class of receptors to trigger increased uptake of glucose and amino acids and to regulate metabolism of glycogen and triglycerides in the cell. Similarly, each of the growth factors initiates in its specific target cells a complex program of cellular events ranging from altered membrane transport of protons, other ions, and metabolites to characteristic changes in the expression of many genes. Some of these responses involve phosphorylation by serine and threonine kinases, while others work via transcription factors that may themselves be kinase substrates. The tyrosine kinase receptors provide attractive targets for drug development. At present, a few compounds have been found to produce effects that may be due to inhibition of tyrosine kinase activities. It is easy to imagine therapeutic uses for specific inhibitors of growth factor receptors, especially in neoplastic disorders.<BR><BR>The intensity and duration of action of EGF, PDGF, and other agents that act via this class of receptors are limited by <A NAME="19"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> down-regulation. Ligand binding induces accelerated endocytosis of receptors from the cell surface, followed by the degradation of those receptors (and their bound ligands). When this process occurs at a rate faster than de novo synthesis of receptors, the total number of cell-surface receptors is reduced (down-regulated) and the cell's responsiveness to ligand is correspondingly diminished.<BR><BR>A growing number of regulators of growth and differentiation, including TGF<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>, act on <A NAME="20"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> serine kinases, another class of transmembrane <A NAME="21"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> enzymes. ANF, an important regulator of blood volume and vascular tone, acts on a transmembrane <A NAME="22"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> whose intracellular domain, a guanylyl cyclase, generates cGMP (see below). Receptors in both groups, like the protein tyrosine kinases, are active in their dimeric forms.<BR><BR><A NAME="o9888"></A><B><b>Cytokine Receptors</b></B><BR><BR>Cytokine receptors respond to a heterogeneous group of peptide ligands that includes growth hormone, erythropoietin, several kinds of interferon, and other regulators of growth and differentiation. These receptors use a recently discovered mechanism (Figure 2-11) that closely resembles that of <A NAME="23"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> tyrosine kinases, but with a difference. In this case, the protein tyrosine kinase activity is not intrinsic to the <A NAME="24"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> molecule; instead, a separate protein tyrosine kinase, from the Janus-kinase (JAK) family, binds noncovalently to the <A NAME="25"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>. As in the case of the EGF-<A NAME="26"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>, cytokine receptors dimerize after they bind the activating ligand, allowing the bound JAKs to become activated and to phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the <A NAME="27"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>. Tyrosine phosphates on the <A NAME="28"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> then set in motion a complex signaling dance by binding another set of proteins, called STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription). Then the bound STATs are themselves phosphorylated by the JAKs, and two STAT molecules dimerize (attaching to one another's tyrosine phosphates). Finally, the STAT/STAT dimer dissociates from the <A NAME="29"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> and travels to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of specific genes. This multistep signaling process furnishes several attractive targets for potential drugs presently undergoing active investigation.<BR><BR><A NAME="o11287"></A><B><b>Ligand-Gated Channels</b></B><BR><BR>Many of the most useful drugs in clinical medicine act by mimicking or blocking the actions of endogenous ligands that regulate the flow of ions through plasma membrane channels. The natural ligands include <b>acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid,</b> and the <b>excitatory amino acids</b> (glycine, aspartate, glutamate, etc). All of these agents are synaptic transmitters.<BR><BR>Each of these receptors transmits its signal across the plasma membrane by increasing transmembrane conductance of the relevant ion and thereby altering the electrical potential across the membrane. For example, acetylcholine causes the opening of the ion channel in the nicotinic acetylcholine <A NAME="30"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> (AchR), which allows Na<sup>&#43;</sup> to flow down its concentration gradient into cells, producing a localized excitatory postsynaptic potential&#151;a depolarization.<BR><BR>The nicotinic Ach <A NAME="31"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> (Figure 2-12) is one of the best characterized of all cell-surface receptors for hormones or neurotransmitters. This <A NAME="32"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> is a pentamer made up of five polypeptide subunits (eg, two alpha chains plus one beta, one gamma, and one delta chain, all with molecular weights ranging from 43,000 to 50,000). These polypeptides, each of which crosses the lipid bilayer four times, form a cylindric structure 8 nm in diameter. When acetylcholine binds to sites on the alpha subunits, a conformational change occurs that results in the transient opening of a central aqueous channel through which sodium ions penetrate from the extracellular fluid into the cell.<BR><BR>The time elapsed between the binding of the agonist to a ligand-gated channel and the cellular response can often be measured in milliseconds. The rapidity of this signaling mechanism is crucially important for moment-to-moment transfer of information across synapses. It contrasts sharply with other molecular signaling mechanisms, which may require seconds, minutes, or even hours, as is the case with gene-active hormones.<BR><BR><A NAME="o13294"></A><B><b>G Proteins &amp; Second Messengers</b></B><BR><BR>Many extracellular ligands act by increasing the intracellular concentrations of second messengers such as cyclic adenosine-3<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#162;</FONT>,5<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#162;</FONT>-monophosphate (cAMP), calcium ion, or the phosphoinositides (described below). In most cases they use a transmembrane signaling system with three separate components. First, the extracellular ligand is specifically detected by a cell-surface <A NAME="33"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>. The <A NAME="34"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> in turn triggers the activation of a G protein located on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. The activated G protein then changes the activity of an effector element, usually an enzyme or ion channel. This element then changes the concentration of the intracellular second messenger. For cAMP, the effector enzyme is adenylyl cyclase, a transmembrane protein that converts intracellular ATP to cAMP. The corresponding G protein, called G<sub>s</sub>, stimulates adenylyl cyclase after being activated by a host of hormones and neurotransmitters, each of which acts via a specific <A NAME="35"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> (see <A TARGET="XCONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetContent&sUI=592752692F5DFE44&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&layout=ccontent.html&getContent=2148-2148&queryId=4069776&matchNum=0&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10">Table 2-1</A>).<BR><BR>G<sub>s</sub> and other G proteins use a molecular mechanism that involves binding and hydrolysis of GTP (Figure 2-13). Significantly, this mechanism separates ligand excitation of the <A NAME="36"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> from G protein-mediated activation of the effector, thereby allowing the transduced signal to be amplified. For example, a neurotransmitter such as norepinephrine may encounter its membrane <A NAME="37"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> for a very short time&#151;only a few milliseconds. When the encounter generates a GTP-bound G<sub>s</sub> molecule, however, the duration of activation of adenylyl cyclase depends upon the longevity of GTP binding to G<sub>s</sub> rather than upon the <A NAME="38"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>'s affinity for norepinephrine. Indeed, like other G proteins, GTP-bound G<sub>s</sub> characteristically remains active for tens of seconds, which enormously amplifies the original signal. This mechanism explains how signaling by G proteins produces the phenomenon of spare receptors (described above). Even though one ligand-activated <A NAME="39"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> molecule is required to initiate GTP binding by one G protein, the slow hydrolysis of GTP causes the active G protein to persist long after the <A NAME="40"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> has dissociated from its agonist molecule. So at low concentrations of agonist the proportion of agonist-bound receptors may be much less than the proportion of G proteins in the active (GTP-bound) state; if the proportion of active G proteins correlates with pharmacologic response, receptors will appear to be spare&#151;ie, a small fraction of receptors occupied by agonist at any given time will appear to produce a proportionately larger response.<BR><BR>The family of G proteins is quite diverse (<A TARGET="XCONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetContent&sUI=592752692F5DFE44&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&layout=ccontent.html&getContent=2149-2149&queryId=4069776&matchNum=0&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10">Table 2-2</A>); in addition to G<sub>s</sub>, the stimulator of adenylyl cyclase, it includes other subfamilies. Members of the G<sub>i</sub> ("i" for inhibitory) subfamily couple receptors to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase; G<sub>i</sub> proteins also mediate <A NAME="41"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> stimulation of the phosphoinositide second messenger system in some cells (see below) and regulation of K<sup>&#43;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> channels. The G<sub>i</sub> subfamily includes two G proteins (G<sub>t1</sub> and G<sub>t2</sub>, also called "transducins"), that mediate phototransduction in retinal rods and cones.<BR><BR>Not surprisingly, receptors coupled to G proteins are structurally related to one another, comprising a family of "serpentine receptors," so called because the <A NAME="42"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> polypeptide chain crosses the plasma membrane seven times (Figure 2-14). Receptors for adrenergic amines, serotonin, acetylcholine (<A NAME="43"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">muscarinic</FONT></B></A> but not nicotinic), many peptide hormones, odorants, and even visual receptors (in retinal rod and cone cells) all belong to the serpentine family. The amino and carboxyl terminals of each of these receptors are located on the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of the membrane, respectively. Different serpentine receptors resemble one another rather closely in amino acid sequences and in the locations of their hydrophobic transmembrane regions and hydrophilic extra- and intracellular loops, suggesting that all were derived from a common evolutionary precursor.<BR><BR>In parallel with these structural similarities, it appears that serpentine receptors transduce signals across the plasma membrane in essentially the same way. Often the agonist ligand&#151;eg, a catecholamine, acetylcholine, or the photon-activated chromophore of retinal photoreceptors&#151;is bound in a pocket enclosed by the transmembrane regions of the <A NAME="44"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> (as in Figure 2-14). The resulting change in conformation of these regions is transmitted to cytoplasmic loops of the <A NAME="45"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>, which in turn activate the appropriate G protein by promoting replacement of GDP by GTP, as described above. Considerable biochemical evidence indicates that the G proteins interact with amino acids in the third cytoplasmic loop of the <A NAME="46"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> polypeptide (shown by arrows in Figure 2-14). The carboxyl terminal tails of these receptors, also located in the cytoplasm, can regulate the receptors' ability to interact with G proteins, as described below.<BR><BR><A NAME="o18499"></A><B><b><A NAME="47"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Receptor</FONT></B></A> Desensitization</b></B><BR><BR><A NAME="48"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Receptor</FONT></B></A>-mediated responses to drugs and hormonal agonists often "desensitize" with time (Figure 2-15, top). After reaching an initial high level, the response (eg, cellular cAMP accumulation, Na<sup>&#43;</sup> influx, contractility, etc) gradually diminishes over seconds or minutes, even in the continued presence of the agonist. This desensitization is usually reversible. Thus, 15 minutes after removal of the agonist, a second exposure to agonist results in a response similar to the initial response. (Note that this ready reversibility distinguishes desensitization from down-regulation of the <i>number</i> of receptors, as described above for <A NAME="49"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> tyrosine kinases.)<BR><BR>Although many kinds of receptors undergo desensitization, the mechanism is in most cases obscure (eg, agonist-induced desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine <A NAME="50"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>). The molecular mechanism of agonist desensitization has been worked out in some detail, however, in the case of the beta adrenoceptor (Figure 2-15, bottom): Binding of agonist induces a change in conformation of the <A NAME="51"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>'s carboxyl terminal tail, causing it to bind, activate,and serve as a substrate for a specific serine or threonine kinase, <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>-adrenoceptor kinase (also termed <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>ARK). The presence of phosphoserines increases the <A NAME="52"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>'s affinity for binding a third protein, <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>-arrestin. Binding of <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>-arrestin to cytoplasmic loops of the <A NAME="53"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> diminishes the <A NAME="54"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>'s ability to interact with G<sub>s</sub>, thereby reducing the agonist response (ie, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase). Upon removal of agonist, however, cellular phosphatases remove phosphates from the <A NAME="55"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> and <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>ARK stops putting them back on, so that the <A NAME="56"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>&#151;and consequently the agonist response&#151;return to normal.<BR><BR><A NAME="o20341"></A><B><b>Well-Established Second Messengers</b></B><BR><BR><b>A. cAMP: </b>Acting as an intracellular second messenger, cAMP mediates such hormonal responses as the mobilization of stored energy (the breakdown of carbohydrates in liver or triglycerides in fat cells stimulated by beta-adrenomimetic catecholamines), conservation of water by the kidney (mediated by vasopressin), Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> homeostasis (regulated by parathyroid hormone), and increased rate and contraction force of the heart muscle (beta-adrenomimetic catecholamines). It also regulates the production of adrenal and sex steroids (in response to corticotropin or follicle-stimulating hormone), the relaxation of smooth muscle, and many other endocrine and neural processes.<BR><BR>cAMP exerts most of its effects by stimulating cAMP-dependent protein kinases (Figure 2-16). These tetrameric kinases are composed of a cAMP-binding regulatory (R) dimer and two catalytic (C) chains. When cAMP binds to the R dimer, active C chains are released which then diffuse through the cytoplasm and nucleus, where they transfer phosphate from ATP to appropriate substrate proteins, often enzymes.<BR><BR>The specificity of cAMP's regulatory effects resides in the distinct protein substrates of the kinase that are expressed in different cells. For example, liver is rich in phosphorylase kinase and glycogen synthase, enzymes whose reciprocal regulation by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation governs carbohydrate storage and release; adipocytes are rich in a lipase whose cAMP-dependent phosphorylation mediates free fatty acid release from fat cells. Similarly, phosphorylation of a kinase specific for the light chains of myosin (called myosin light chain kinase, or MLCK) is involved in relaxation of smooth muscle by beta-adrenomimetic amines. Other cell-specific responses to cAMP as a second messenger similarly depend upon the many enzymes available for regulation by phosphorylation.<BR><BR>When the hormonal stimulus stops, the intracellular actions of cAMP are terminated by an elaborate series of enzymes. cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation of enzyme substrates is rapidly reversed by a diverse group of specific and nonspecific phosphatases. cAMP itself is degraded to 5<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#162;</FONT>-AMP by several distinct cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE, Figure 2-16). Competitive inhibition of cAMP degradation is one way caffeine, theophylline, and other methylxanthines produce their effects (see <A TARGET="CONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetTOC&sUI=592752692F5DFE44&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&getTOC=2481-2481&queryId=4069776&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10#2481-2481">Chapter 20</A>).<BR><BR><b>B. Calcium and Phosphoinositides: </b>A second well-studied second messenger system involves hormonal stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Figure 2-17). Some of the hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors that trigger this pathway (<A TARGET="XCONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetContent&sUI=592752692F5DFE44&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&layout=ccontent.html&getContent=2148-2148&queryId=4069776&matchNum=0&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10">Table 2-1</A>) bind to receptors linked to G proteins, while others bind to <A NAME="57"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> tyrosine kinases. In all cases, however, the crucial step is stimulation of a membrane enzyme, phospholipase C (PLC), which specifically hydrolyzes a minor phospholipid component of the plasma membrane called phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). PIP<sub>2</sub> is split into two second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub> or InsP<sub>3</sub>). The first of these messengers is confined to the membrane, where it activates a phospholipid- and calcium-sensitive protein kinase called protein kinase C. The other messenger, IP<sub>3</sub>, is water-soluble and diffuses through the cytoplasm, where it triggers the release of Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> from internal storage vesicles. Elevated cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> concentration promotes the binding of Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> to the calcium-binding protein calmodulin, which regulates activities of other enzymes, including calcium-dependent protein kinases.<BR><BR>With its multiple second messengers and protein kinases, the phosphoinositide signaling pathway is much more complex than the cAMP pathway. For example, different cell types may contain one or more specialized calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinases with limited substrate specificity (eg, myosin light chain kinase) in addition to a general calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinase that can phosphorylate a wide variety of protein substrates. Furthermore, at least nine structurally distinct types of protein kinase C have been identified.<BR><BR>Much of our understanding of the biologic roles of phosphoinositide second messengers comes from the use of pharmacologic agents that activate either the Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> or the protein kinase C pathways. The concentration of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> can be elevated by calcium ionophores, while protein kinase C is directly stimulated by binding phorbol esters or synthetic diacylglycerols. One or both of these classes of agents may reproduce the biologic response triggered by a physiologic signal using the phosphoinositide pathway.<BR><BR>As in the cAMP system, multiple mechanisms exist to damp or terminate signaling by this pathway. IP<sub>3</sub> is rapidly inactivated by dephosphorylation; diacylglycerol is either phosphorylated to yield phosphatidic acid, which is then converted back into phospholipids, or it is deacylated to yield arachidonic acid; Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> is actively removed from the cytoplasm by Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> pumps.<BR><BR>These and other nonreceptor elements of the calcium-phosphoinositide signaling pathway are now becoming targets for drug development. For example, the therapeutic effects of lithium ion, an established agent for treating manic-depressive illness, may be mediated by effects on the metabolism of phosphoinositides (see <A TARGET="CONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetTOC&sUI=592752692F5DFE44&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&getTOC=2637-2637&queryId=4069776&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10#2637-2637">Chapter 29</A>).<BR><BR><b>C. cGMP: </b>Unlike cAMP, the ubiquitous and versatile carrier of diverse messages, cGMP (cyclic guanosine-3<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#162;</FONT>,5<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#162;</FONT>-monophosphate) has established signaling roles in only a few cell types. In intestinal mucosa and vascular smooth muscle, the cGMP-based signal transduction mechanism closely parallels the cAMP-mediated signaling mechanism. Ligands detected by cell surface receptors stimulate membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, and cGMP acts by stimulating a cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The actions of cGMP in these cells are terminated by enzymatic degradation of the cyclic nucleotide and by dephosphorylation of kinase substrates.<BR><BR>Increased cGMP concentration causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle by a kinase-mediated mechanism that results in dephosphorylation of myosin light chains. In these smooth muscle cells, cGMP synthesis can be elevated by two different transmembrane signaling mechanisms utilizing two different guanylyl cyclases. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), a blood-borne peptide hormone, stimulates a transmembrane <A NAME="58"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> by binding to its extracellular (ligand-binding) domain; this binding event triggers activation of the guanylyl cyclase activity that resides in the <A NAME="59"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>'s intracellular domain. The other mechanism takes advantage of the fact that cell membranes are permeable to the stimulating ligand, nitric oxide (NO, a gas; <A TARGET="CONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetTOC&sUI=592752692F5DFE44&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&getTOC=2464-2464&queryId=4069776&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10#2464-2464">Chapter 19</A>). The nitric oxide is generated in vascular endothelial cells in response to natural vasodilator agents such as acetylcholine and histamine (nitric oxide is also called endothelium-derived relaxing factor [EDRF]). After entering the cell, nitric oxide binds to and activates a cytoplasmic guanylyl cyclase. A number of useful vasodilating drugs act by generating or mimicking nitric oxide (see Chapters <A TARGET="CONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetTOC&sUI=592752692F5DFE44&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&getTOC=2258-2258&queryId=4069776&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10#2258-2258">11</A> and <A TARGET="CONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetTOC&sUI=592752692F5DFE44&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&getTOC=2297-2297&queryId=4069776&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10#2297-2297">12</A>).<BR><BR><A NAME="o27945"></A><B><b>Interplay Among Signaling Mechanisms</b></B><BR><BR>The calcium-phosphoinositide and cAMP signaling pathways oppose one another in some cells and are complementary in others. For example, vasopressor agents that contract smooth muscle act by IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated mobilization of Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup>, whereas agents that relax smooth muscle often act by elevation of cAMP. In contrast, cAMP and phosphoinositide second messengers act together to stimulate glucose release from the liver.<BR><BR><A NAME="o28439"></A><B><b>Phosphorylation: A Common Theme</b></B><BR><BR>Almost all second messenger signaling involves reversible phosphorylation. It plays a key role at every step, from regulation of receptors (autophosphorylation of tyrosine kinases and desensitization of receptors linked to G proteins) to kinases regulated by second messengers and finally to substrates of these kinases that may themselves be kinases. These covalent modifications perform two principal functions in signaling, amplification and flexible regulation. In <b>amplification,</b> rather like GTP bound to a G protein, the attachment of a phosphoryl group to a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue powerfully amplifies the initial regulatory signal by recording a molecular memory that the pathway has been activated; dephosphorylation erases the memory, taking a longer time to do so than is required for dissociation of an allosteric ligand. In <b>flexible regulation,</b> differing substrate specificities of the multiple protein kinases regulated by second messengers provide branch points in signaling pathways that may be independently regulated. In this way, cAMP, Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup>, or other second messengers can use the presence or absence of particular kinases or kinase substrates to produce quite different effects in different cell types.<BR><BR><BR>
