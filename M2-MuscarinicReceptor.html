<P><u>Transmembrane topology and action of a M2-muscarinic receptor.</u>.<br>
The receptor's amino (N) terminal is extracellular (above the plane of the membrane),
and its carboxyl (C) terminal intracellular. The terminals are connected by a
polypeptide chain that traverses the plane of the membrane seven times. The hydrophobic
transmembrane segments (light color) are designated by roman numerals (I-VII). Acetylcholine
(Ach) approaches the receptor from the extracellular fluid and binds to a site surrounded
by the transmembrane regions of the receptor protein. G proteins (G) interact with
cytoplasmic regions of the receptor, especially with portions of the third cytoplasmic
loop between transmembrane regions V and VI. The receptor's cytoplasmic terminal tail
contains numerous serine and threonine residues whose hydroxyl (-OH) groups can be
phosphorylated. This phosphorylation may be associated with diminished receptor-G
protein interaction.<br>
M2-muscarinic receptor activation is coupled to opening of K+ channels causing potassium
to flow outside the cell producing hyperpolarization.  The heart becomes more refractory
to contraction and the rate slows.<br>
M2-muscarinic receptors cause <b>action in the heart</b> in the following manner:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Heart SA node: decrease in heart rate.
	<li>Heart AV node: decrease in conduction velocity
	<li>Heart Atria: decrease in contractility
</ul>
