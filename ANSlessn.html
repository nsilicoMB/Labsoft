<BR>A firm understanding of the therapeutics of the autonomic nervous system
the primary goal of the Therapeutics III module.  Once the fundamentals of
autonomic pharmacology are mastered, many previously unfamiliar concepts in
physiology and clinical pharmacy will begin to make sense.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>At a first glance, autonomic pharmacology appears to be a mass of unrelated
material to be memorized.  However, the opposite is in fact true, as there is
a definite conceptual framework from which much of the subject logically follows.
The purpose of this handout is to present this framework concisely, in a
step-by-step fashion.  Once this framework is mastered, you will be able to
do further reading in autonomic pharmacology without difficulty.  In addition,
you will have the background necessary to benefit maximally from the lectures,
discussions, and laboratories on autonomic pharmacology in Therapeutics.&nbsp;

1. <U>The autonomic nervous system</U> (ANS) is that portion of the nervous
system that controls the so-called visceral functions of the body (cardiac
function, blood pressure, respiration, glandular activity, etc.). In this
Section, an introduction to ANS anatomy and function will be presented.&nbsp;
</DIR>
<DIR>
<I>2.</I> In order to understand the relationship between the ANS and the
nervous system as a whole, the general organization of the latter must
be reviewed briefly. The human nervous system can be divided into the <U>central
nervous system</U> (CNS), consisting of the brain and spinal cord, and
the <U>peripheral</U> <U>nervous</U> <U>system</U>, consisting of the cranial
and spinal nerves and their branches. The 12 pairs of cranial nerves (labeled
I - XII) originate from the base of the brain. The 31 pairs of spinal nerves
include 8 pairs of cervical nerves (labeled Cl - C8), 12 pairs of thoracic
nerves (labeled T1 - T12), 5 pairs of lumbar nerves (labeled L1 - L5),
5 pairs of sacral nerves (labeled S1 - S5), and 1 pair of coccygeal nerves
and roots.&nbsp;

<BR>3. A nerve, such as the
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>cranial</select> or
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>spinal</select> nerves
discussed in the previous question, is simply a bundle of-<U>nerve fibers</U>.
Four types of nerve fibers are found in most nerves:&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
</DIR>

<DIR>
<DIR>
(i) <U>somatic</U> <U>afferent</U> (sensory) <U>fibers</U>, which
convey impulses from the head, body wall, and extremities to the CNS&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>(ii) <U>somatic</U> <U>efferent</U> (motor) <U>fibers</U>, which convey
impulses from the CNS to the striated (&quot;voluntary&quot;) muscles&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>(iii) <U>visceral</U> <U>afferent</U> (sensory) <U>fibers</U>, which convey
impulses from the internal; organs to the CNS&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>(iv) <U>visceral</U> <U>efferent</U> (motor) <U>fibers</U>, which convey
impulses from the CNS to the internal organs, glands, and the smooth and
cardiac (&quot;involuntary&quot;) muscles&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;
</DIR>
</DIR>

Taken together, the visceral afferent and visceral efferent fibers form
the autonomic nervous <U>system</U> (ANS). In contrast, the somatic afferent
and somatic efferent fibers form the <U>somatic nervous system</U>. Thus,
the ANS and the somatic nervous system can be regarded as subdivisions
of the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>peripheral</select> nervous system.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<DIR>
<BR>4. Summary of human nervous system organization:&nbsp;

<BR><select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>central</select> nervous system&nbsp;

		</DIR>
	</DIR>
</DIR>
<DIR>
<BR>5. The subdivision of the peripheral nervous system into the ANS and the
somatic nervous system is based primarily on the differences in the structures
innervated. Thus, the fibers of the ANS convey sensory input from the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>internal organs</select>
and motor output to the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>internal organs, glands, smooth and cardiac muscle,</select>
while the fibers of the somatic nervous system convey sensory input from the
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>head, body wall, and extremities</select>
and motor output to the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>striated muscles</select>. However, other
differences between the ANS and the somatic nervous system exist, the
most important of which concerns the anatomy of the efferent (motor) pathways
in these systems, as described in the following question.&nbsp;
</DIR>
<DIR>
<BR>6. In the <U>somatic</U> nervous system, the efferent fibers pass uninterruptedly
from the CNS to the appropriate effector cells. In contrast, the efferent
fibers in the <U>ANS synapse</U> en route. This difference between the
two systems can be illustrated schematically as follows:&nbsp;
</DIR>
<BR>&nbsp;
<A NAME="Fig2"></A>
<BR><IMG SRC="somatic2.gif" height=600 width=400>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>A peripheral ganglion simply is defined as a cluster of neuron cell bodies
located outside the CNS.&nbsp;
<dir>
<BR>7. In the somatic nervous system, the term neuromuscular junction generally
is used instead of neuroeffector cells junction, since <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>striated muscle</select>
cells are the only types of effector cells innervated by that system.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>8. The above ANS efferent pathway illustrates a synapse between a preganglionic
fiber and multiple postganglionic neurons. A given preganglionic fiber
can branch and synapse with as many as 30 postganglionic neurons in one
or more peripheral ganglia.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>9. In the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>autonomic</select> nervous system, nerve impulses are transmitted
from the CNS to peripheral <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ganglia</select> on the fibers of
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>preganglionic</select>
neurons and from these peripheral <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ganglia</select> to effector cells
on the fibers of <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>postganglionic</select> neurons. Thus, an impulse
from the CNS must travel on the fibers of <U>two </U>neurons to reach an
effector cell controlled by that system (see, however, question 10). In
contrast, in the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>somatic</select> nervous system, an impulse can travel
from the CNS to a given effector cell on the fibers of a <U>single</U>
neuron.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>10. Since the glands of the body are controlled by the ANS, their cells
receive impulses from the CNS via a two-neuron pathway. An apparent exception
is the <U>adrenal medulla</U>, whose cells are innervated by fibers that
pass uninterruptedly from the CNS. However, these fibers are anatomically
and biochemically identical to autonomic preganglionic fibers and the cells
of the adrenal medulla are embryologically, anatomically, and functionally
homologous to autonomic postganglionic neurons. Thus, the adrenal medulla
is <U>not</U> a typical gland: it is classified more correctly as a component
of the ANS.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>11. Although the subject of autonomic pharmacology includes <U>all</U>
drugs which affect smooth muscle, gland cells, etc., most autonomic drugs
act by modifying impulse transmission at either the peripheral ganglia
or the neuroeffector junctions. Therefore, the study of
the ANS in the remainder of this Lesson (and in the Therapeutics course)
will focus on its <U>efferent</U> pathways (cf. question 6) almost exclusively.
(Actually, some neuroanatomy and pharmacology textbooks restrict their
definition of the ANS so that only the efferent pathways are included.)&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>12. Since most autonomic drugs exert their effects at either the peripheral
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ganglia</select> or the
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>neuroeffector</select> junctions, only
the efferent pathways of the ANS must be studied in detail for an understanding
of autonomic pharmacology. On the basis of anatomical, biochemical, pharmacological,
and functional criteria, each such pathway can be placed in one of two
categories: the s<U>ympathetic division</U> or the <U>parasympathetic</U>
division. The functional and anatomical differences between these divisions
will be discussed in the remainder of this Section; biochemical and pharmacological
differences will be considered in later Sections.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>13. In general, the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS
can be regarded as <U>physiological antagonists</U>, i.e. if one division
carries impulses which inhibit a certain function, then the other division
usually carries impulses which augment that function. The responses of
various effector organs to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli are
presented in the following Table:&nbsp;

<BR>
<BR>To make sense out of the diverse responses listed here, note that the stimulation
of the s<U>ympathetic</U> division (including the adrenal medulla; see
question 21 below) causes physiological changes which prepare the body
for emergency and stress (&quot;<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>fight or flight</select>&quot;) situations,
such as increased heart rate, shunting of blood from skin, mucosa, and
abdominal viscera to skeletal muscle (due to vasoconstriction in the former
tissues and vasodilation in the latter), decreased gastrointestinal motility,
and increased sphincter tone. In contrast, the stimulation of the parasympathetic
division is associated with conservative and restorative processes, such
as decreased heart rate, increased gastrointestinal motility, and decreased
sphincter tone. Although most organs are innervated by both sympathetic
and parasympathetic fibers, important exceptions include the sweat glands,
pilomotor muscles, and most blood vessels, which receive sympathetic innervation
exclusively.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<DIR>
<BR>14. Most organs and glands respond in an opposite manner to impulses
carried by the two divisions of the ANS. in general, responses to sympathetic
stimuli are appropriate to emergency and stress situations, while responses
to parasympathetic stimuli conserve and restore the body's resources. Furthermore,
as a result of certain anatomical and biochemical differences between the
two divisions (to be discussed below and in Section B), the sympathetic
division tends to affect widespread regions of the body or even the entire
body for sustained periods of time, while the parasympathetic division
produces selective, localized responses of short duration.&nbsp;

<DIR>16. The anatomical distinctions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions now will be considered. Although both divisions contain the two-neuron
efferent pathway which structurally differentiates the ANS from the somatic
nervous system (cf. question 6), the origin of the preganglionic fibers,
the location of the peripheral ganglia, and the degree of branching of
the preganglionic fibers differ in the two divisions, as discussed in the
following questions.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>17. Differences in the origin of the preganglionic fibers will be considered
first. In the <U>sympathetic</U> division, the preganglionic fibers emerge
from the CNS in the thoracic and upper two lumbar spinal nerves (i.e. spinal
nerves T1 - L2 ; cf. question 2). In the <U>parasympathetic</U> division,
the preganglionic fibers emerge in cranial nerves III, VII , IX , and X
and in the second, third, and fourth sacral spinal nerves (i.e. spinal
nerves S2 - S4). Based on these differences in preganglionic fiber origin,
the terms <U>thoracolumbar division</U> and <U>craniosacral division</U>
often are used synonymously with sympathetic division and parasympathetic
division, respectively.&nbsp;

<BR>18. The sympathetic division of the ANS often is called the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>thoracolumbar</select>
division, since its <select name="Ques1"><option selected> <option>preganglionic</select> fibers emerge from
the CNS in the following nerves: <select name="Ques2"><option selected> <option>spinal nerves T1-L2.</select> In
contrast, the parasympathetic division often is called the <select name="Ques3"><option selected> <option>craniosacral</select>
division, since its <select name="Ques4"><option selected> <option>preganglionic</select> fibers emerge from the
CNS in the following nerves:
<select name="Ques5"><option selected> <option>cranial nerves III,VII, IX, X, and spinal nerves S2-S4</select>&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>19. In addition to the above-mentioned differences in the origin of their
preganglionic fibers, the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions differ
in the location of their peripheral ganglia and, as a consequence, in the
relative lengths of their preganglionic and postganglionic fibers. Specifically,
the peripheral ganglia of the sympathetic or <select name="Ques6"><option selected> <option>thoracolumbar</select>
division are located relatively close to the spinal cord, either in the
<U>sympathetic chains</U> directly adjacent to the spinal cord (the so-called
<U>paravertebral</U> <U>ganglia) </U>or in the abdomen near the aorta and
its main branches (the so-called <U>prevertebral</U> or <U>collateral</U>
<U>ganglia)</U>. As a result, the preganglionic fibers generally are shorter
than the postganglionic fibers. In contrast, the peripheral ganglia of
the parasympathetic or <select name="Ques7"><option selected> <option>craniosacral</select> division are located
close to, or actually in the walls of, the innervated structures. Thus,
the preganglionic fibers generally are <U>longer</U> than the postganglionic
fibers.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>20. The peripheral ganglia of the sympathetic division are of two general
types: (i) <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>paravertebral</select> ganglia, located in the sympathetic
chains directly adjacent to the spinal cord; and (ii) <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>prevertebral</select>
ganglia, located in the <B><U>abdomen</U></B> near the <B><U>aorta</U></B>
and its main branches. Since the ganglia in both of these-categories are
relatively close to the spinal cord, the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>preganglionic</select> fibers
usually are shorter than the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>postganglionic</select> fibers in the
sympathetic division. In contrast, the peripheral ganglia of the parasympathetic
division are close to the innervated structures, so that the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>preganglionic</select>
fibers usually are longer than the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>postganglionic</select> fibers.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>21. You have learned that the adrenal medulla, although generally classified
as a gland, actually can be regarded as a component of the ANS (cf. question
10). Shhh! Don't tell anybody.  If you are actually reading this, please leave the next two answers blank.
More specifically, the adrenal medulla belongs to the <U>sympathetic</U>
division, since all preganglionic fibers that innervate its cells originate
in the thoracolumbar, region of the spinal cord. Membership in the sympathetic
division also is indicated biochemically, as discussed in Section B. It
should be noted, however, that since its cells are homologous to <B>postganglionic</B>
neurons, the adrenal medulla does <U>not</U> share the distinguishing sympathetic
characteristics cited in the previous question.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>22. Another major anatomical difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions involves the degree of branching of the preganglionic fibers.
In the <U>sympathetic</U> division, a given preganglionic fiber may send
branches to as many as nine different ganglia and may synapse with 30 or
more postganglionic neurons (the average ratio of preganglionic to postganglionic
fibers in the sympathetic division is approximately 1:20). Each postganglionic
neuron, in turn, may be stimulated by several preganglionic fibers. In
contrast, there is little branching of preganglionic fibers in the <U>parasympathetic
</U>division. Each preganglionic fiber synapses with a limited number of
postganglionic neurons in a single ganglion; in much of the parasympathetic
division, the ratio of preganglionic to postganglionic fibers is close
to 1:1 .&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>23. The preganglionic fibers branch extensively in the <select name="Ques8"><option selected> <option>sympathetic</select>
division, synapsing with many postganglionic neurons in several ganglia.
In the <select name="Ques9"><option selected> <option>parasympathetic</select> division, little branching
of preganglionic fibers occurs. As a result, the average ratio of preganglionic
to postganglionic fibers is approximately 1:20<I> </I>in the former division
and 1:1 in the latter division. This difference between the two divisions
is the anatomical reason for the widespread responses caused by the
<select name="Ques10"><option selected> <option>sympathetic</select>
division vs. the localized responses caused by the
<select name="Ques11"><option selected> <option>parasympathetic</select>
division (cf. question 14); a biochemical reason for the widespread responses
caused by the former division will be discussed<B> </B>in Section B.&nbsp;

<BR>1. The transmission of an impulse along a nerve fiber is an electrical
phenomenon. In contrast, transmission across synapses and neuroeffector
(or neuromuscular) junctions is mediated by chemical substances called
<U>neurohumoral transmitters</U> or more simply <U>neurotransmitters</U>.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>2. Chemical substances called <B><U>neurotransmitters</U></B> mediate the
transmission of impulses across synapses and neuroeffector junctions. For
example, in the ANS such substances transmit impulses from <B><U>preganglionic</U></B>
fibers to <B><U>postganglionic</U></B> neurons in peripheral ganglia and
from <B><U>postganglionic</U></B> fibers to effector cells, activating
these cells.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>3. Since most autonomic drugs act by modifying impulse transmission at
either the peripheral ganglia or the neuroeffector junctions (see Section
D), a study of autonomic pharmacology requires a thorough understanding
of autonomic neurotransmitters and the steps of the neurohumoral transmission
process.&nbsp;
</dir>

<BR>These topics will be discussed in this Section. Transmission at the neuromuscular
junctions of the <U>somatic</U> nervous system also will be considered,
because of its similarity to transmission at certain locations in the ANS.&nbsp;
<dir>
<BR>4. The main neurotransmitters in the ANS are <U>acetylcholine</U> (ACh)
and <U>norepinephrine</U> (NE; also called noradrenaline):&nbsp;
</dir>
<A NAME="Fig5"></A>
<BR><IMG SRC="achnorep.gif" HEIGHT=101 WIDTH=452>&nbsp;
<BR>The terms <U>cholinergic</U> and <U>adrenergic</U> are used when describing
impulse transmission mediated by ACh and NE, respectively.&nbsp;
<dir>
<BR>5. <U>Cholinergic</U> transmission (i.e. transmission mediated by the neurotransmitter
<select name="Ques12"><option selected> <option>acetylcholine(ACh)</select> is known to occur at the following locations:&nbsp;
	<dir>
	(i) <U>all</U> neuroeffector junctions in the parasympathetic division&nbsp;<br>
	(ii) <U>some</U> neuroeffector junctions in the sympathetic division
		Specifically, in the sweat glands in most individuals and in some blood
		vessels)&nbsp;<br>
	(iii) all peripheral ganglia (i.e. at the synaptic junctions between
		<select name="Ques13"><option selected> <option>preganglionic</select>
		fibers and <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>postganglionic</select> neurons)&nbsp;<br>
	(iv) <U>all</U> neuromuscular junctions in the somatic nervous system&nbsp;
	</dir>
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>6. <U>Adrenergic</U> transmission (i.e. transmission mediated by the neurotransmitter
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>norepinephrine (NE)</select> occurs at most neuroeffector junctions
in the sympathetic division. The exceptions are the neuroeffector junctions
in the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>sweat</select> glands (most individuals) and in some
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>blood vessels</select> where
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>cholinergic</select> transmission is found.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR><I>7.</I> Although <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ACh</select> is the transmitter at all <U>peripheral
ganglia</U> in the ANS, the predominant transmitter at the <U>neuroeffector
junctions</U> is <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ACh</select>in the parasympathetic division and
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>NE</select> in the sympathetic division. Thus, these two divisions
differ biochemically as well as functionally and anatomically (cf. question A-12).&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>8. In Section A, you learned that the parasympathetic division of the ANS
often is called the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>craniosacral</select>
division, since its <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>preganglionic</select>
fibers emerge from the CNS with the following nerves:
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>cranial nerves III, VII, IX, X; spinal nerves S2-S4</select>.
Sometimes, this division also is called the <U>cholinergic</U> division, since
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ACh</select> mediates transmission at all
parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions. In other words, it is the activation of effector cells
by <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ACh</select> that produces the parasympathetic
responses listed in question A-13.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>9. You also learned in Section A that the sympathetic division of the ANS
often is called the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>thoracolumbar</select>-
division, since its <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>preganglionic</select>
fibers emerge from the CNS with the following nerves:
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>spinal nerves T1-L2</select>.
This division also can be called the <U>adrenergic division</U>, since
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>NE</select> mediates transmission at most sympathetic
neuroeffector junctions (the exceptions are the-sympathetic neuroeffector
junctions in <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>sweat glands (most individuals); and some blood vessels</select>,
which can be referred to as <U>sympathetic cholinergic</U>). In other words,
it is the activation of effector cells by <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>NE</select>(and a closely
related compound secreted by the adrenal medulla; see question 12 below)
which produces <U>most</U> sympathetic responses listed in question A-13.
The remaining sympathetic responses are due to the activation of effector
cells by <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ACh</select> at sympathetic cholinergic neuroeffector junctions.&nbsp;
</dir>
<BR>
<BR>10. Summary of neurohumoral transmission:&nbsp;<br>

<A NAME="Fig6"></A>
<IMG SRC="blockaut.gif" HEIGHT=438 WIDTH=466>&nbsp;

<dir>
<br>11. In Section A, you learned that the adrenal medulla, while commonly
regarded as a gland, actually is a component of the ANS. Since its cells
are innervated by preganglionic fibers from the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>thoracolumbar</select>
region of the spinal cord, the adrenal medulla is included in the
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>sympathetic</select>
division, although membership in this division also is in located by the
nature of the chemical compounds which it releases. Specifically, the cells
of the adrenal medulla, which are homologous to <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>postganglionic</select>
neurons, secrete <U>epinephrine </U>(EPI; also called adrenaline), a hormone
structurally and functionally similar to NE, as well as small amounts of
NE itself (the EPI : NE ratio is approximately 4:1).&nbsp;
</dir>

<A NAME="Fig7"></A>
<BR><IMG SRC="epinorep.gif" HEIGHT=129 WIDTH=454>&nbsp;

<dir>
<BR>12. EPI and NE are released by the cells of the adrenal medulla. However,
instead of being released in the immediate vicinity of a neuroeffector
junction, like the NE released by typical sympathetic postganglionic fibers,
EPI and NE from the adrenal medulla are secreted into the bloodstream and
are distributed in this way to sympathetic neuroeffector junctions in all
parts of the body. Since the adrenal medulla generally is stimulated whenever
the sympathetic division is activated (e.g. during &quot;fight or flight&quot;),
the sympathetic responses listed in question A-13 include the effects of
circulating EPI and NE from the adrenal medulla as well as the effects
of locally released NE. Sympathetic responses at <U>sympathetic</U> <U>cholinergic</U>
neuroeffector junctions, however, result from locally released <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ACh</select>
only).&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>13. You have learned that the sympathetic division tends to affect widespread
regions of the body, while the parasympathetic division generally produces
localized responses (cf. question A-14). The structural reason for this
difference between the two divisions was discussed in Section A: the preganglionic
fibers branch extensively in the sympathetic division (average ratio of
preganglionic to postganglionic fibers is approximately <U>1:20</U>), whereas
little branching of preganglionic fibers occurs in the parasympathetic
division (average ratio of preganglionic to postganglionic fibers is approximately
<U>1:1</U>). The biochemical reason for the widespread sympathetic response
now has been presented: <U>EPI</U> and <U>NE</U>, secreted by the <U>adrenal
medulla</U> are distributed to all regions of the-body through the <U>bloodstream.</U>
This contributes to the sustained nature of sympathetic responses as well.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>14. Now that the autonomic neurotransmitters and their sites of action
have been identified, the transmission process itself will be discussed.
At both synaptic and neuroeffector junctions, neurohumoral transmission
can be regarded as a four-step sequence of events:&nbsp;
</dir>

<DIR>
	<DIR>I. synthesis and storage of the neurotransmitter in the prejunctional fiber&nbsp;
	<BR>II. release of the neurotransmitter from storage vesicle (exocytosis)&nbsp;
	<BR>III. interaction of the neurotransmitter with the postjunctional cell and
		initiation of postjunctional activity&nbsp;
	<BR>IV. destruction or dissipation (deactivation) of the neurotransmitter&nbsp;
	</DIR>
</DIR>
This sequence is particularly useful in autonomic pharmacology, since the
actions of many autonomic drugs can be related directly to their effects
on these individual steps.&nbsp;
<dir>
<BR>15. Although a complete description of each step in the transmission process
is beyond the scope of this Lesson, some further discussion of step IV
is required for an understanding of certain functional differences between
the two divisions of the ANS. These additional details on neurotransmitter
deactivation are presented in the following six questions.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>16. At a given synaptic or neuroeffector junction, three potential mechanisms
exist for neurohumoral deactivation:&nbsp;
</dir>
<DIR>
	<DIR>(i) <U>diffusion</U> of the neurotransmitter away from the junction&nbsp;
	<BR>(ii) <U>enzymatic</U> <U>destruction</U> of the neurotransmitter&nbsp;
	<BR>(iii) <U>reuptake</U> of the neurotransmitter by the prejunctional fiber&nbsp;
	</DIR>
</DIR>
<br>
The relative importance of each mechanism at a given junction depends on
the type of transmission that occurs at that junction.&nbsp;

<dir>
<BR>17. <U>Enzymatic destruction</U> of the neurotransmitter is the predominant
deactivation mechanism at <U>cholinergic</U> junctions. Specifically, ACh
is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is concentrated
at these junctions.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>18. Cholinergic transmission occurs at the following locations (cf. question
5):&nbsp;
</dir>
<DIR>
	<DIR>(i) <U>all</U> neuroeffector junctions in the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>parasympathetic</select>division&nbsp;
	<BR>(ii) some neuroeffector junctions in the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>sympathetic</select> division&nbsp;
	<BR>(iii) <U>all</U> peripheral <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>ganglia</select>&nbsp;
	<BR>(iv) <U>all</U> neuromuscular junctions in the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>somatic</select> nervous system&nbsp;
	</DIR>
</DIR>
<br>

The predominant mechanism for transmitter deactivation at each of these
junctions is <U>enzymatic hydrolysis of ACh by AchE.</U>&nbsp;

<dir>
<BR>19. Adrenergic transmission occurs at most neuroeffector junctions in the
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>sympathetic</select>division of the ANS. At these junctions, the
primary mechanism-for neurohumoral deactivation probably is <U>reuptake</U>
by the prejunctional fiber the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>postganglionic</select> fiber,
in this case, with <U>diffusion</U> playing a secondary role. The reuptake
process, however, is considerably more effective for <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>NE</select> ,
the neurotransmitter released locally by the prejunctional fibers, than
for <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>EPI</select> the hormone secreted by the adrenal medulla.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>20. In mammals, two enzymes are present that can metabolize NE and EPI:
monoamine oxidase (MAO), which is located primarily in mitochondria, and
catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), a cytoplasmic enzyme. While neither
of these enzymes plays a significant role in the deactivation of NE and
EPI at sympathetic neuroeffector junctions, they are important for the
metabolism of <U>circulating</U> EPI (and NE) from the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>adrenal medulla</select>
and for the metabolism of <U>exogenously</U> <U>administered</U> EPI and
NE.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>21. In Section A, you learned that the sympathetic division tends to exert
its effects for sustained periods of time, while the parasympathetic division
produces responses of short duration. Although the sustained sympathetic
effects are due at least in part to circulating EPI and NE from the adrenal
medulla (cf. question 13), differences in the neurohumoral deactivation
mechanisms also are important. At most sympathetic neuroeffector junctions,
the major deactivation mechanism probably is
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>reuptake by the prejunctional fiber</select>,
with <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>diffusion away from the junction</select> playing
a secondary role. These processes occur slowly relative to
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>enzymatic hydrolysis of ACh by AChE</select>,
the mechanism whereby ACh is deactivated at <U>parasympathetic</U> neuroeffector junctions.&nbsp;

1. In Section B of this Lesson, you learned that impulses are transmitted
across synapses and neuroeffector junctions by chemical compounds called
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>neurotransmitters</select>. Specifically, you learned that transmission
at most sympathetic neuroeffector junctions is mediated by
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>norepinephrine (NE)</select>
Transmission at the remaining sympathetic neuroeffector junctions
(i.e. at the so-called <B>sympathetic cholinergic</B> neuroeffector junctions),
at all parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions, at the synapses in peripheral
ganglia, and at somatic neuromuscular junctions is mediated by
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>acetylcholine (ACh)</select>.
In each case, transmission can be regarded as a four-step
process: (refer to question B-14 for listing of steps).<B>&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>2. Many details of the above transmission process were omitted from Section
B. For example, the interaction between neurotransmitter and postjunctional
cell (step III) appears to involve specific sites or <U>receptors</U> on
the cell. Since a study of these receptors is <U>essential</U> to an understanding
of effector organ responses to various neurotransmitters and drugs, a detailed
discussion of postjunctional receptors and their classification will be
presented in this Section.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>3. A <U>receptor</U> can be defined as a site on a postjunctional cell
with which a neurotransmitter (or drug) interacts, initiating some activity.
For example, at a synaptic junction in a peripheral ganglion, ACh released
by the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>preganglionic</select> fiber interacts with receptors on the
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>postganglionic</select> neuron, stimulating the latter. Similarly,
at an autonomic neuroeffector junction, ACh or NE released by the
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>postganglionic</select>
fiber interacts with receptors on an effector cell, causing some response.
Circulating EPI (secreted by the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>adrenal medulla</select>) and drugs
also can interact with receptors. In each of these cases, the neurotransmitter
(or drug) - receptor interaction appears to be quite <U>specific</U> ,
i.e. only certain neurotransmitters (or drugs) are effective at any given
receptor.<B>&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>4. You might expect that a given postjunctional receptor simply could be
classified as <U>adrenergic </U>or <U>cholinergic</U>, according to the
type of neurohumoral transmission involved. Unfortunately from the student's
point of view , but fortunately from the therapeutic point of view, the
situation is somewhat more complex: these receptors can in fact be classified
as either adrenergic or cholinergic, but within each category <U>subdivisions</U>
are necessary.<B>&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>5. In the remainder of this Section, the two main classes of postjunctional
receptors and their subdivisions will be discussed. While these two classes,
the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>adrenergic</select> receptors
and the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>cholinergic</select>
receptors, simply correspond to the two types of
<select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>neurohumoral </select>transmission
found in the peripheral nervous system, the existence of subdivisions within
each class only can be demonstrated pharmacologically, i.e. on the basis
of selective responses to certain drugs.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>6. The <U>cholinergic receptors</U> can be subdivided into two groups:
the <U>muscarinic</U> receptors (so-named because they are selectively
stimulated by small doses of muscarine) and the <U>nicotinic</U> receptors
(so-named because they are selectively stimulated by small doses of nicotine).
Receptors belonging to only <U>one</U> subdivision are found at any given
cholinergic junction, as described in the following question.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>7. Cholinergic transmission occurs at the following four locations (cf.
question B-5):&nbsp;
	<dir>
	<BR>(i) all parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions muscarinic&nbsp;
	<BR>(ii) sympathetic cholinergic receptors neuroeffector junctions cholinergic&nbsp;
	<BR>(iii) all peripheral ganglia nicotinic receptors&nbsp;
	<BR>(iv) all somatic neuromuscular receptors junctions&nbsp;
	</DIR>
</DIR>

Although cholinergic receptors are found at all of these locations, those
at (i) and (ii) belong to the <U>muscarinic </U>subdivision, while those
at (iii) and iv) belong to the <U>nicotinic</U> subdivision.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<DIR>
8. In Section A, you learned that the blood vessels are controlled
almost exclusively by the sympathetic division of the ANS. Therefore, a
general absence of cholinergic receptors would be expected, except for
the muscarinic receptors at the sympathetic cholinergic neuroeffector junctions
found in some blood vessels. However, for reasons which are not understood,
almost <U>all</U> blood vessels contain considerable numbers of muscarinic
receptors, even though <U>no</U> cholinergic fibers are present: Stimulation
of these receptors, which only can be accomplished by drugs or locally
administered ACh (except where sympathetic cholinergic fibers are present),
leads to dilation.&nbsp;
</dir>
<dir>
<BR>9. Although the subdivision of cholinergic receptors originally was based
on selective responses to muscarine and nicotine, this subdivision can
be made on the basis of responses to other drugs as well.&nbsp;

stimulated by such drugs as phenylephrine) and <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>-receptors</U>
(selectively stimulated by such drugs as isoproterenol). In the present discussion, emphasis will be placed on the
types of adrenergic receptors associated with different effector organs
and the relationship between this receptor distribution and effector organ
responses.&nbsp;
</dir>

<dir>
<br>12.	Adrenergic receptors are found at all junctions where adrenergic transmission occurs, i.e. at most sympathetic neuroeffector junctions.  Depending on the effector organ involved, <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>-receptors</U>, <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>-receptors</U>, or a mixture of <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>-receptors</U> and <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>-receptors</U> may be found at any given sympathetic neuroeffector junction.  In the latter case, one receptor type generally is responsible for mediating the predominant physiological response.

13.	You have learned that all cholinergic receptors at parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions and sympathetic cholinergic neuroeffector junctions belong to the <select name="Ans"><option selected> <option>muscarinic</select> subdivision.  As illustrated in the previous question, the situation at most sympathetic neuroeffector junctions is much more complex: the adrenergic receptors at these junctions may be <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>-receptors</U>, or a mixture of <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT></U> and <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>-receptors</U>.  A knowledge of the distribution of <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT></U> and <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>-receptors</U> among different organs is essential for an understanding of the effects of certain autonomic drugs which act selectively at receptors of one type.  Although this receptor distribution appears to be hopelessly random, it begins to make sense when the types of responses associated with different adrenergic receptors are considered, as discussed in the following questions.
</dir>

<dir>
14.	In general (cf. question 12), <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>1-receptors</U> are associated with <U>excitatory responses</U> (contraction, constriction, etc.), while <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>2-receptors</U> are associated with inhibitory responses (relaxation, dilation, etc.). Important exceptions are the <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>-receptors</U> in the gastrointestinal tract and the <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>-receptors</U> in the heart: they must be classified pharmacologically as <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>2</U> and <U><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT>1 -receptors</U>, respectively, stimulation of the former results in a decrease in gastrointestinal tone and motility (i.e. inhibitory responses), while stimulation of the latter results in an increase in heart rate, contractility, and conduction velocity (i.e. excitatory responses).
</dir>

<dir>
15. Many extracellular ligands act by increasing the intracellular concentrations of second messengers
	such as cyclic adenosine-3<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#162;</FONT>,5<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#162;</FONT>-monophosphate
	(cAMP), calcium ion, or the phosphoinositides (described below). In most cases they use a transmembrane
	signaling system with three separate components. First, the extracellular ligand is specifically detected
	by a cell-surface receptor. The receptor in turn triggers the activation of
	a G protein located on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. The activated G protein then
	changes the activity of an effector element, usually an enzyme or ion channel. This element then changes
	the concentration of the intracellular second messenger. For cAMP, the effector enzyme is adenylyl cyclase,
	a transmembrane protein that converts intracellular ATP to cAMP. The corresponding G protein, called
	G<sub>s</sub>, stimulates adenylyl cyclase after being activated by a host of hormones and neurotransmitters,
	each of which acts via a specific receptor.<br>
</dir>
<dir>
16.	G<sub>s</sub> and other G proteins use a molecular mechanism that involves binding and hydrolysis
	of GTP. Significantly, this mechanism separates ligand excitation of the
	receptor from G protein-mediated activation
	of the effector, thereby allowing the transduced signal to be amplified. For example, a neurotransmitter
	such as norepinephrine may encounter its membrane receptor
	for a very short time&#151;only a few milliseconds. When the encounter generates a GTP-bound G<sub>s</sub>
	molecule, however, the duration of activation of adenylyl cyclase depends upon the longevity of
	GTP binding to G<sub>s</sub> rather than upon the receptor's
	affinity for norepinephrine. Indeed, like other G proteins, GTP-bound G<sub>s</sub> characteristically
	remains active for tens of seconds, which enormously amplifies the original signal.<BR>
</dir>
<dir>
17.	The family of G proteins is quite diverse (see next Table); in addition to G<sub>s</sub>, the stimulator of
	adenylyl cyclase, it includes other subfamilies. Members of the G<sub>i</sub> ("i" for inhibitory)
	subfamily couple receptors to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase; G<sub>i</sub> or G<sub>q</sub> proteins
	also mediate receptor stimulation of the phosphoinositide
	second messenger system in some cells (see below) and regulation of K<sup>&#43;</sup> and
	Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> channels. The G<sub>i</sub> subfamily includes two G proteins (G<sub>t1</sub>
	and G<sub>t2</sub>, also called "transducins"), that mediate phototransduction in retinal rods and cones.<BR>

18.	Not surprisingly, receptors coupled to G proteins are structurally related to one another, comprising
	a family of "serpentine receptors," so called because the receptor
	polypeptide chain crosses the plasma membrane seven times.<br>

	<P>
	<br>Receptors for adrenergic amines, serotonin, acetylcholine (muscarinic
	but not nicotinic), many peptide hormones, odorants, and even visual receptors (in retinal rod and
	cone cells) all belong to the serpentine family. The amino and carboxyl terminals of each of these
	receptors are located on the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of the membrane, respectively.
	Different serpentine receptors resemble one another rather closely in amino acid sequences and in
	the locations of their hydrophobic transmembrane regions and hydrophilic extra- and intracellular
	loops, suggesting that all were derived from a common evolutionary precursor.<BR>
</dir>
<dir>
19. In parallel with these structural similarities, it appears that serpentine receptors transduce
	signals across the plasma membrane in essentially the same way. Often the agonist
	ligand&#151;eg, a catecholamine, acetylcholine, or the photon-activated chromophore of retinal
	photoreceptors&#151;is bound in a pocket enclosed by the transmembrane regions of the
	receptor. The resulting change in conformation of these regions is transmitted to cytoplasmic loops of the
	receptor, which in turn activate the appropriate
	G protein by promoting replacement of GDP by GTP, as described above.<BR>
