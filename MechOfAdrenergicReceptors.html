				<B><font color=#0000FF><b>MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF SYMPATHOMIMETIC ACTION</b></font></B><BR><BR><A NAME="o98"></A><B><b>Introduction</b></B><BR><BR>The effects of catecholamines are mediated by cell surface receptors. As described in <A TARGET="CONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetTOC&sUI=073B4FDA9293045D&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&getTOC=2139-2139&queryId=4103840&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10#2139-2139">Chapter 2</A>, these receptors are coupled by G proteins to the various effector proteins whose activities are regulated by those receptors. Each G protein is a heterotrimer consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. G proteins are classified on the basis of their distinctive alpha subunits. G proteins of particular importance for adrenoceptor function include G<sub>s</sub>, the stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase; G<sub>i</sub>, the inhibitory G protein of adenylyl cyclase; and G<sub>q</sub>, the protein coupling alpha receptors to phospholipase C. The activation of G protein-coupled receptors by catecholamines promotes the dissociation of GDP from the alpha subunit of the appropriate G protein. GTP then binds to this G protein, and the alpha subunit dissociates from the beta-gamma unit. The activated GTP-bound alpha subunit then regulates the activity of its effector. Some effectors of adrenoceptor-activated alpha subunits include adenylyl cyclase, cGMP phosphodiesterase, phospholipase C, and ion channels. The alpha subunit is inactivated by hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP and P<sub>i</sub>, and the subsequent reassociation of the alpha subunit with the beta-gamma subunit. The beta-gamma subunit may have additional independent effects, acting on a variety of effectors such as ion channels and enzymes.<BR><BR><A NAME="o1582"></A><B><b><A NAME="1"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Receptor</FONT></B></A> Types</b></B><BR><BR><b>A. Alpha Receptors:</b> The mechanism of activation of alpha receptors by catecholamines is not as well understood as that of beta receptors. Typically, <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>1</sub> receptors can be shown to stimulate polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol.<BR><BR>In certain smooth muscle cells, <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>1</sub>-<A NAME="2"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> activation leads to an influx of calcium across the membrane. Alpha<sub>1</sub>-<A NAME="3"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> activation in many cells leads to the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides into inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (Figure 9-1). G proteins in the G<sub>q</sub> family couple <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>1</sub> receptors to phospholipase C. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) promotes the release of sequestered Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> from intracellular stores, which increases the cytoplasmic concentration of free Ca<sup>2&#43;</sup> and the activation of various calcium-dependent protein kinases. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is sequentially dephosphorylated, which ultimately leads to the formation of free inositol. However, several other phosphorylated isomers of inositol may be produced and accumulate owing to the metabolism of 1,4,5-trisphosphate; the biologic significance of these other molecules is unclear. Diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. In addition, recent evidence indicates that <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>1</sub> receptors activate signal transduction pathways that have traditionally been associated with peptide growth factors. For example, <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>1</sub> receptors have been found to activate mitogen-activated kinases (MAP kinases) and polyphosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase). These pathways may have importance for the <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>1</sub> <A NAME="4"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A>-mediated stimulation of cell growth. The physiologic significance of this "cross talk" between major signaling pathways remains to be determined.<BR><BR>Alpha<sub>2</sub> receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity and cause intracellular cAMP levels to decrease. While this effect has been well documented, it is not clear whether this action is the exclusive or major expression of <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>2</sub>-<A NAME="5"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> activation. Thus, <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>2</sub>-<A NAME="6"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> agonists cause platelet aggregation and a decrease in platelet cAMP levels, but it is not clear that aggregation is the result of the decrease in cAMP. Alpha<sub>2</sub> inhibition of adenylyl cyclase occurs through the mediation of the inhibitory regulatory protein, G<sub>i</sub>, that couples the <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>2</sub> <A NAME="7"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Figure 9-2). How the activation of G<sub>i</sub> leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is unclear. Two major possibilities are (1) that the free beta-gamma units of G<sub>i</sub> combine with the free alpha subunits of G<sub>s</sub>, rendering them inactive; and (2) that the alpha subunit of G<sub>i</sub> directly inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. Some evidence favors both of these possible mechanisms. In addition, some of the effects of <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#97;</FONT><sub>2</sub> adrenoceptors are independent of their ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase; mechanisms include activation of potassium channels and closing of calcium channels. These actions may be mediated by G proteins of the G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> class.<BR><BR><b>B. Beta Receptors:</b> The mechanism of action of beta agonists has been studied in considerable detail. Activation of all three <A NAME="8"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> subtypes (<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT><sub>1</sub>, <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT><sub>2</sub>, and <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT><sub>3</sub>) results in activation of adenylyl cyclase and increased conversion of ATP to cAMP (Figure 9-2). Activation of the cyclase enzyme is mediated by the stimulatory coupling protein G<sub>s</sub>. cAMP is the major second messenger of <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>-<A NAME="9"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> activation. For example, in the liver of many species, <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>-<A NAME="10"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> activation increases cAMP synthesis, which leads to a cascade of events culminating in the activation of glycogen phosphorylase. In the heart, <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>-<A NAME="11"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> activation increases the influx of calcium across the cell membrane and its sequestration inside the cell. Beta-<A NAME="12"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> activation also promotes the relaxation of smooth muscle. While the mechanism is uncertain, it may involve the phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase to an inactive form (see Figure 12-1). Beta adrenoceptors may activate voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the heart independently of changes in cAMP concentration via G<sub>s</sub>-mediated enhancement.<BR><BR><b>C. Dopamine Receptors:</b> The D<sub>1</sub> <A NAME="13"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> is typically associated with the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (<A TARGET="XCONTENT" HREF="/STATRef/tserver.dll?command=doGetContent&sUI=073B4FDA9293045D&database=MEDICINE&useScheme=STATREF.Scheme&layout=ccontent.html&getContent=2237-2237&queryId=4103840&matchNum=0&getSearchResults=1-10&numMatches=10">Table 9-1</A>); for example, D<sub>1</sub>-receptorinduced smooth muscle relaxation is presumably due to cAMP accumulation in the smooth muscle of those vascular beds where dopamine is a vasodilator. D<sub>2</sub> receptors have been found to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity, open potassium channels, and decrease calcium influx.<BR><BR><A NAME="o6552"></A><B><b><A NAME="14"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Receptor</FONT></B></A> Regulation</b></B><BR><BR>Responses mediated by adrenoceptors are not fixed and static. The number and function of adrenoceptors on the cell surface and their responses may be regulated by catecholamines themselves, other hormones and drugs, age, and a number of disease states. These changes may modify the magnitude of a tissue's physiologic response to catecholamines. One of the best-studied examples of <A NAME="15"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> regulation is the <b>desensitization</b> of adrenoceptors that may occur after exposure to catecholamines and other sympatho-mimetic drugs. After a cell or tissue has been exposed for a period of time to an agonist, that tissue often becomes less responsive to further stimulation by that agent. Other terms such as tolerance, refractoriness, and tachyphylaxis have also been used to denote desensitization. This process has considerable clinical significance because it may limit the therapeutic response to sympathomimetic agents.<BR><BR>The mechanisms involved in desensitization of cells to responses mediated by beta adrenoceptors have been extensively studied. There appear to be at least three distinct mechanisms. In some cells, desensitization is caused by <A NAME="16"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> sequestration (a rapid and transient event wherein the receptors are made temporarily unavailable for activation by agonists). A second process, down-regulation (ie, disappearance of the receptors from the cell), may take place by the action of enzymes on the <A NAME="17"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> or by decreased synthesis. Third, phosphorylation of the <A NAME="18"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> on the cytoplasmic side by protein kinase A or <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>-<A NAME="19"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">adrenergic</FONT></B></A> <A NAME="20"><B><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">receptor</FONT></B></A> kinase (<FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>ARK) may impair coupling of beta adrenoceptors with G<sub>s</sub>. <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>ARK is a specific example of a large class of related proteins that phosphorylate G protein-coupled receptors. The phosphorylation induced by <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>ARK may disrupt coupling to G<sub>s</sub>, in part by facilitating association of <FONT FACE='SYMBOL'>&#98;</FONT>-arrestin, a 48 kDa protein, with phosphorylated beta adrenoceptors (Figure 2-15).<BR><BR><BR>
