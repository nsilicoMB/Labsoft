<b>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
The prediction of anatoxin concentrations and the risk of toxicity to humans and animals presented on this web page should not be used to
make decisions about personal safety or the use of Russian River recreation opportunities.</b> These predictions are based on a simple mathematical
relationship between river water temperature, river flow, and air temperature that will never be absolutely accurate. My intention for the
publication of this model is to help the Sonoma County Water Agency and the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors to exercise adaptive management
of Russian River flow and thus avoid the bloom of blue-green algae and potential river toxicity.
<P>

<b>July 23, 2018:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: As I reported last week the conditions have been right for a bloom of blue-green algae and last week the predictive model showed a low level of 3.3 ug/L. In fact the
Sonoma County Department of Health Services (SCDHS) has now reported an <a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">"Algal Bloom at Riverfront Regional Park:</a>
Although they do not monitor the lakes at Riverfront Regional Park near Windsor, visual inspection by a water expert indicates the presence of potentially harmful algal blooms in Lake Wilson."
The predicted change in the anatoxin-a model equations moved into a negative range this week due to continued good flow (~92 to 110 cpf) and there is no longer a positive prediction level. I assume that
the SCDHS has resumed testing in the main Russian River since they reported "Please note, currently there are no restrictions along the Russian River."
<br>

<b>July 16, 2018:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: At the beginning of July, the anatoxin-a prediction model moved toward a warning of a low level (3.3 ug/L on 7/6/2018)
of anatoxin-a for the first time this year. This estimate is due to the high water temperature (75 deg. F) and lower river flow (~75 cfs).
I can't tell if the Sonoma County Department of Health has started to test for anatoxin-a yet. The State trigger level to post warnings is
"any detected" and the warning level for anatoxin-a is 20 ug/L. So if the model estimate is correct but the county has not started testing,
then we are still 10 times lower than the official State warning level. I did see that right after the hot spell the water flow was increased from
75 cfs to ~100 cfs which helps to dilute the anatoxin and reduce water temperature. As of today the model is still predicting ~1 ug/L so I'll
try to make more frequent updates to the web site.
<br>

<b>June 24, 2018:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: As the Russian River water temperature rises, the river flow decreases, the dams go in, and people flock to the river
on hot days, it becomes more important to have many methods to evaluate the risk of toxicity to humans and animals. Therefore, I am providing this public
disclosure of a model that specifically
<A HREF="./DailyRRLowFlowToxicity.html">predicts the concentration of anatoxin-a in the lower Russian River.</A>
My primary purpose is only to inform
the Sonoma County Water Agency and the Board of Supervisors of potential risks of toxicity so that they will consider increasing the river flow
to prevent the bloom of blue-green algae and lower the concentration of toxins.
<br>
Beginning the week after Memorial Day, the Sonoma County Department of Health Services (DHS) works
collaboratively with the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (NCRWQCB) to provide river condition
information. Data on water temperature and flows as well as visual monitoring (algal mats, stagnation, etc.) is reviewed and evaluated
weekly basis. When conditions are favorable for the growth of blue-green algae (aka cyanobacteria), laboratory sampling for cyanobacteria toxins
will begin. Once initiated, water sample testing will be performed at 10 public beaches along the Russian River. If toxins are detected at
a level above the thresholds established by the 2016 California Cyanobacteria Harmful Algal Bloom Network Guidance, DHS will issue public
notifications and post signs at the beaches.
<br>
The DHS response and public warning comes <b>only after</b> the observation river toxicity. I have proposed to all of the relevant agencies
(SCWA, BOD, DHS, and NCRWQCB) that utilization of a simple computer model of anatoxin-a concentration would allow them to
adopt adaptive responses to the threat of river toxicity and simply increase the flow of water in the river to <b>prevent</b> the toxicity.
<br>
We are now starting a new summer after a year of relatively little rain and after the devastating fires in Sonoma County. There will be
increasing political and economic pressure to conserve water for new housing developments that are served by SCWA (east of Mirabel). It will
be incumbent upon us (Sonoma County Residents) to continue asking our leaders to help protect our most valuable natural resouce, the Russian River.

<b>Sept 24, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: As of September 11, 2017 there was no measureable amount of anatoxin-a in the Russian River. (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
Flow is still high, water temperature is lower, and air temperature is normal. All of these parameters tend to inhibit the growth of blue-green algae. This will be the last blog entry for the summer of 2017. Today I'm
pulling my little green sailboat out at Johnson's beach. The dam at Johnson's beach comes out Sept. 30th. Hope you have a great winter.
<br>

<b>Aug 29, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: As of August 21, 2017 there was no measureable amount of anatoxin-a in the Russian River. (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
Flow is high, water temperature is lower, and air temperature is high. All of these parameters tend to inhibit the growth of blue-green algae. This will be the last blog entry for the summer of 2017 unless
conditions change dramatically.
<br>

<b>Aug 18, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: As of August 14, 2017 there was no measureable amount of anatoxin-a in the Russian River. (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
This is good news and is probably due to the drop in river temperature and the maintenance of flow > 100 cfs. That is all for today. I'm going to take a swim in the River.
<br>

<b>Aug 6, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: On July 31st 2017 a low level (0.25 ug/L) of anatoxin-a was reported at Johnson's Beach in Guerneville (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
In addition, a low level of anatoxin-a was reported at Steelhead Beach (0.16 ug/L). These levels are 100 times <b>lower</b> than
the State of California Warning levels <b>so there is no need for alarm at this point</b>. In spite of the high river water temperature, the predictive model for anatoxin-a has not moved into
a positive region of change yet (<A HREF="./DailyRRLowFlowToxicity-Derivative.html">Click here for a plot of the predicted change in daily anatoxin concentration</A>).
However, the model had one of its lowest negative derivative values (-0.49 ug/L/day). A negative value means that anatoxin-a is not predicted to build up with the current conditions.
If the derivative value becomes positive we might expect anatoxin-a concentration to increase on a daily basis. The negative derivative value is mainly due to the fact that the river flow is still above 100 cfs.
The flow was down to 126 cfs on July 29th but had increased to 146 cfs by Aug. 2nd. This change in flow might be normal variability or it might reflect adaptive control by the Sonoma County Water Agency.
If anyone reading this blog knows if SCWA increased the flow in response to the measured anatoxin-a please let me know by sending Email to the address listed below.
I will continue to update this blog on a periodic basis and attempt to keep the public informed about changes in the predicted risk for toxicity.
<br>

<b>July 25, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: On July 24th 2017 we saw the first reports of measureable levels of anatoxin-a in the Russian River (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
The following sites had very low levels of anatoxin-a: Cloverdale River Park Beach (0.16 ug/L), Del Rio Woods Beach (0.15 ug/L), and Patterson Point (0.14 ug/L). These levels are 100 times <b>lower</b> than
the State of California Warning levels <b>so there is no need for alarm at this point</b>. In spite of the high river water temperature, the predictive model for anatoxin-a has not moved into
a positive region of change yet (<A HREF="./DailyRRLowFlowToxicity-Derivative.html">Click here for a plot of the predicted change in daily anatoxin concentration</A>).
This is mainly due to the fact that the river flow is still above 100 cfs. The water temperature near Guerneville spiked to 77 deg. F in late June but the river flow was high enough to lower the risk of anatoxin production.
I will continue to update this blog on a periodic basis and attempt to keep the public informed about changes in the predicted risk for toxicity.

<br>
Please don't let the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors (SCBOD) ignore this easily avoidable and potentially life-threatening
Russian River blue-green algae related toxicity! Encourage your supervisor and the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) to adopt adaptive management of
Russian River flows. Let's use an advanced computer model to predict when to expect a bloom of blue-green algae and the subsequent increase in cyanotoxin
levels, and then adjust the river flow to easily avoid the potential toxicity.<br>

<P>
My recommendation is for Sonoma County Residents to contact your supervisor and encourage them to instruct SCWA to utilize this type of
simulation model to manage the Russian River flows when the conditions of flow, water temperature, and air temperature could give rise to this
type of toxicity.
