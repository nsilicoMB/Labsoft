<b>July 25, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: On July 24th 2017 we saw the first reports of measureable levels of anatoxin-a in the Russian River (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
The following sites had very low levels of anatoxin-a: Cloverdale River Park Beach (0.16 ug/L), Del Rio Woods Beach (0.15 ug/L), and Patterson Point (0.14 ug/L). These levels are 100 times <b>lower</b> than
the State of California Warning levels <b>so there is no need for alarm at this point</b>. In spite of the high river water temperature, the predictive model for anatoxin-a has not moved into
a positive region of change yet (<A HREF="./DailyRRLowFlowToxicity-Derivative.html">Click here for a plot of the predicted change in daily anatoxin concentration</A>).
This is mainly due to the fact that the river flow is still above 100 cfs. The water temperature near Guerneville spiked to 77 deg. F in late June but the river flow was high enough to lower the risk of anatoxin production.
I will continue to update this blog on a periodic basis and attempt to keep the public informed about changes in the predicted risk for toxicity.
<br>

<b>Aug 6, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: On July 31st 2017 a low level (0.25 ug/L) of anatoxin-a was reported at Johnson's Beach in Guerneville (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
In addition, a low level of anatoxin-a was reported at Steelhead Beach (0.16 ug/L). These levels are 100 times <b>lower</b> than
the State of California Warning levels <b>so there is no need for alarm at this point</b>. In spite of the high river water temperature, the predictive model for anatoxin-a has not moved into
a positive region of change yet (<A HREF="./DailyRRLowFlowToxicity-Derivative.html">Click here for a plot of the predicted change in daily anatoxin concentration</A>).
However, the model had one of its lowest negative derivative values (-0.49 ug/L/day). A negative value means that anatoxin-a is not predicted to build up with the current conditions.
If the derivative value becomes positive we might expect anatoxin-a concentration to increase on a daily basis. The negative derivative value is mainly due to the fact that the river flow is still above 100 cfs.
The flow was down to 126 cfs on July 29th but had increased to 146 cfs by Aug. 2nd. This change in flow might be normal variability or it might reflect adaptive control by the Sonoma County Water Agency.
If anyone reading this blog knows if SCWA increased the flow in response to the measured anatoxin-a please let me know by sending Email to the address listed below.
I will continue to update this blog on a periodic basis and attempt to keep the public informed about changes in the predicted risk for toxicity.

<b>Aug 18, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: As of August 14, 2017 there was no measureable amount of anatoxin-a in the Russian River. (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
This is good news and is probably due to the drop in river temperature and the maintenance of flow > 100 cfs. That is all for today. I'm going to take a swim in the River.
<br>

<b>Aug 29, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: As of August 21, 2017 there was no measureable amount of anatoxin-a in the Russian River. (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
Flow is high, water temperature is lower, and air temperature is high. All of these parameters tend to inhibit the growth of blue-green algae. This will be the last blog entry for the summer of 2017 unless
conditions change dramatically.

<b>Sept 24, 2017:</b><br>
Sonoma County residents: As of September 11, 2017 there was no measureable amount of anatoxin-a in the Russian River. (<a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/health/services/bluegreen.asp#Content" target="_blank">Sonoma County Dept. of Health Services Blue-Green Algae</a>).
Flow is still high, water temperature is lower, and air temperature is normal. All of these parameters tend to inhibit the growth of blue-green algae. This will be the last blog entry for the summer of 2017. Today I'm
pulling my little green sailboat out at Johnson's beach. The dam at Johnson's beach comes out Sept. 30th. Hope you have a great winter.

Please don't let the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors (SCBOD) ignore this easily avoidable and potentially life-threatening
Russian River blue-green algae related toxicity! Encourage your supervisor and the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) to adopt adaptive management of
Russian River flows. Let's use an advanced computer model to predict when to expect a bloom of blue-green algae and the subsequent increase in cyanotoxin
levels, and then adjust the river flow to easily avoid the potential toxicity.<br>

<P>
My recommendation is for Sonoma County Residents to contact your supervisor and encourage them to instruct SCWA to utilize this type of
simulation model to manage the Russian River flows when the conditions of flow, water temperature, and air temperature could give rise to this
type of toxicity.
