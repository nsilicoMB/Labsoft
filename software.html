Cyber Patient <sup>(TM)</sup> Abstract:</H2>
<DD>
The Cyber Patient:  A Multimedia Pharmacokinetic Simulation Program for Case Study Generation in a Problem-Solving Curriculum.
Michael B. Bolger,  Simulations Plus, Inc., Lancaster, CA
	Cyber Patient is a multimedia pharmacokinetic (PK) simulation program that can be used for development and presentation of problem-solving case studies.  This simulation program is appropriate for use in pharmacy or medical schools to assist the instructor in development of PK drug models.  The PK drug models are used by students to generate their own data for use in a problem-solving curriculum.  In addition, Cyber Patient can be used in the pharmaceutical industry for pharmacokinetic drug simulations.
	The Cyber Patient simulation is an MS-Windows program based on a numerical method for solution of the differential equations that describe one and two compartment models.  The simulation places the user in the role of a health care professional that has primary care responsibility for a patient who is taking medication.  The user can load a PK model from the disk or create a model by entering the appropriate PK parameters into text boxes on the main screen.  A patient view menu can be programmed by the instructor to contain a sound (.WAV) or video (.AVI) files that describes the patient's condition.  When blood levels are too low the user observes a "sick" patient and when therapeutic blood levels are achieved, the user observes a "treated" patient.  However, if blood levels get too high the patient can be programmed to have a "toxic" reaction.
	Each time the simulation is run, the user must select five time points for collection of drug level data from the central compartment.  Following the simulation, blood level data is displayed in graphical format as well as being placed in the Windows clipboard  (with random error) for convenient pasting into another application or spreadsheet for determination of the best fit parameters.
	In addition to the simulation of pharmacokinetics, Cyber Patient contains an extensive help system that is a "hypertext" introduction to basic pharmacokinetics.  The Help system allows the user to search for information about pharmacokinetic terms and to follow "hypertext" links from one topic to the next.

     Welcome to the Cyber Patient pharmacokinetic drug
simulation program.  You will find the compressed ".zip" file
"CyberPatiSetupFiles_zip" to be the easiest method for generating the
Windows XP setup files.  Change the file name from "CyberPatiSetupFiles_zip" to "CyberPatiSetupFiles.zip"
in a clean subdirectory.
<br><B><a href="loginCP.htm">Download a copy of Version 1.2 now.</a></B><BR>
     To install this program and the various support files
start MS-Windows XP and run the SETUP.EXE program.  This will
copy the .DLL, .VBX files and the Graphics Server program to your
Windows/System subdirectory.  It will ask where you would like
for the Cyber Patient to be installed.  The default is
C:\Program Files\CybrPati\.  When the installation is complete you should
make a directory for media files called C:\Program Files\CybrPati\MEDIA.  Then
you should move all of the .WAV, and .BMP files to that
subdirectory.
     In addition to Cyber Patient, you will find two MS-Excel
spreadsheets "1CMPART.XLS" and "2CMPART.XLS" that can be used
with SOLVER to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of a
data set generated by the Cyber Patient.
     After each run of the simulation, Cyber Patient places its
kinetic data on the Windows clipboard for convenient pasting
into other applications.
     Please see fixes.txt for changes from version 1.1.

A Computer Program for the Calculation and
Visualization of Drug Degradation pH Rate Profiles
<br>
<br>
Michael B. Bolger and Ian S. Haworth <br>
 	PharmLabTM is an MS-Windows program that computes a time course for drug
	degradation and can be used to calculate a pH rate profile for a drug.
	We have used the program in an educational setting to illustrate and examine
	the kinetics of the hydrolysis of ionizable esters as a function of the
	molecular structure of the ester.  In addition to the educational value,
	we believe that the simple relationships used to parameterize the program
	provide some new insights into the pH rate profile for ester hydrolysis,
	and could offer an accurate predictive method, given a broader-based
	parameterization.  The program is based on experimental rate profiles
	and on numerical integration of the differential equations that describe
	the hydrolysis of ionizable esters.  The influence of the pKa of the
	ionizable group on the experimental rate profiles follows from standard
	differential rate equations.  Empirical parameters derived as a function
	of the pKa values of the reactants and products in the hydrolysis reaction
	were used to calculate changes in rate constants caused by changes in the
	molecular structure.  We illustrate the derivation of these parameters for
	a series of esters structurally similar to procaine (2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl
	4-aminobenzoate), and show how the pH rate profiles we obtain can be
	interpreted in terms of the structural differences between the esters.
